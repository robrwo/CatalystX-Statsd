# NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::Statsd - Log Catalyst stats to statsd

# VERSION

version v0.8.2

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use Catalyst qw/
   Statsd
   -Stats=1
 /;

use Net::Statsd::Tiny;

__PACKAGE__->config(
  'psgi_middleware', [
      Statsd => {
          client => Net::Statsd::Tiny->new,
      },
  ],
);

# (or you can specify the Statsd middleware in your
# application's PSGI file.)
```

# DESCRIPTION

This plugin will log [Catalyst](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst) timing statistics to statsd.

## CONFIGURATION

```perl
__PACKAGE__->config(

  'Plugin::Statsd' => {
      disable_stats_report => 0,
  },

);
```

## `disable_stats_report`

Enabling stats will also log a table of statistics to the Catalyst
log.  If you do not want this, then set `disable_stats_report`
to true.

Note that if you are modifying the `log_stats` method or using
another plugin that does this, then this may interfere with that if
you disable the stats report.

This defaults to

```
!$c->debug
```

# METHODS

## `statsd_client`

```
$c->statsd_client;
```

Returns the statsd client.

This is the statsd client used by [Plack::Middleware::Statsd](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack%3A%3AMiddleware%3A%3AStatsd).

## `statsd_metric_name_filter`

```
$c->statsd_metric_name_filter( $stat_or_name );
```

This method returns the name to be used for logging stats, or `undef`
if the metric should be ignored.

Only alphanumeric characters, hyphens or underscores in namespaces are
accepted. All other characters are converted to dots, with consecutive
dots compressed into a single dot.

If it is passed a non-arrayref, then it will stringify the argument
and return that.

If it is passed an array reference, then it assumes the argument comes
from [Catalyst::Stats](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst%3A%3AStats) report and is converted into a suitable metric
name.

You can override or modify this method to filter out which metrics you
want logged, or to change the names of the metrics.

# METRICS

## `catalyst.response.time`

This logs the Catalyst reponse time that is normally reported by
Catalyst.  However, it is probably unnecessary since
[Plack::Middleware::Statsd](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack%3A%3AMiddleware%3A%3AStatsd) also logs response times.

## `catalyst.sessionid`

If [Catalyst::Plugin::Session](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst%3A%3APlugin%3A%3ASession) or [Plack::Middleware::Session](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack%3A%3AMiddleware%3A%3ASession) is
used, or anything that adds a `sessionid` method to the context, then
the session id is added as a set, to count the number of unique
sessions.

## `catalyst.stats.*.time`

These are metrics generated from [Catalyst::Stats](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst%3A%3AStats).

All non-word characters in the paths in an action are changed to dots,
e.g. the timing for an action `/foo/bar` will be logged with the
metric `catalyst.stats.foo.bar.time`.

The metric name is generated by ["statsd\_metric\_name\_filter"](#statsd_metric_name_filter).

# KNOWN ISSUES

## Custom Profiling Points

If you have custom profiling points, then these will be treated as
top-level names in the `catalyst.stats.*` namespaces, e.g.

```perl
my $stats = $c->stats;
$stats->profile( begin => 'here' );

...

$stats->profile( end => 'here' );
```

will be logged to statsd in the `catalyst.stats.here.time` namespace.

If you do not want this, then you can work around this by prefixing
the block name with a controller name, e.g.

```perl
$stats->profile( begin => 'controller.here' );
```

## Large Databases When Profiling

When profiling your application, the size of your stats database may
grow quite large.

Your database storage and retention settings should be adjusted
accordingly.

# SUPPORT FOR OLDER PERL VERSIONS

Since v0.8.0, the this module requires Perl v5.14 or later.

Future releases may only support Perl versions released in the last ten years.

If you need this module on Perl v5.10, please use one of the v0.7.x
versions of this module.  Significant bug or security fixes may be
backported to those versions.
