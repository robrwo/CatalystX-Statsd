# NAME

Catalyst::Plugin::Statsd - log Catalyst stats to statsd

# VERSION

version v0.1.3

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use Catalyst qw/
   Statsd
   -Stats=1
 /;

__PACKAGE__->config(
  'psgi_middleware', [
      Statsd => {
          client => Net::Statsd::Tiny->new,
      },
  ],
);

# (or you can specify the Statsd middleware in your
# application's PSGI file.)
```

# DESCRIPTION

This plugin will log [Catalyst](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst) timing statistics to statsd.

# METRICS

## `catalyst.response.time`

This logs the Catalyst reponse time that is normally reported by
Catalyst.  However, it is probably unnecessary since
[Plack::Middleware::Statsd](https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Middleware::Statsd) also logs response times.

## `catalyst.stats.*.time`

These are metrics generated from [Catalyst::Stats](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst::Stats).

# KNOWN ISSUES

Enabling stats will also log a table of statistics to the Catalyst
log.  If you do not want this, then you will need to subclass
[Catalyst::Stats](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst::Stats) or modify your logger accordingly.
